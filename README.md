## Expected compensation

The hourly rate for the work is $35, and I anticipate the project will require approximately 25 to 28 working hours. This translates to a total cost ranging from $875 to $980.

| Expected hours | Task |

| 6 | materials collection and text processing |
| 4 | communication (email, video call) |
| 10 | visual design |
| 4 | text design |
| 2 | review and final editing of the work |

## Tools

I will be using these platforms for designing: 

- [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/): an image editor for most of the visual design, including digital drawing.

- [Krita](https://krita.org/en/): a professional open source painting program

- [Canva](https://www.canva.com/): a design tool for presentations and social media. I will be using canva for the text design.
